gnuSMV - The YASMINE project

README
======

This directory contains the microcode files YASMINE. Due to size, the
microcode is currently distributed as a bz2 tarball called
`microcode.tar.bz2`. Unpack the contents of this tarball and set the
environment variable `YASMV_HOME` to its parent directory.

The microcode covers the full set of supported operators on n-bit
integers (n varying from 1 to 64). It is required to enable support
for integer and (FUTURE) fixed-point arithmetic.
