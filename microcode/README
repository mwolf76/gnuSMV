README
======

This directory contains the microcode files for yasmv. Due to its hefty size,
the microcode is currently distributed as a bz2 tarball called
`microcode.tar.bz2`. Unpack the contents of this tarball in a directory of
choice and set the environment variable `YASMV_HOME` to point to its parent.
