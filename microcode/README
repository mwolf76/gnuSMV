======

This directory contains the microcode files for YASMINE. Due to its
size, the microcode is currently distributed as a bz2 tarball called
`microcode.tar.bz2`. Unpack the contents of this tarball and set the
environment variable `YASMV_HOME` to its parent directory.

The microcode covers the full set of supported operators on n-bits
integers (n varying from 1 to 64). It is *required* to enable support
for integer and (FUTURE) fixed-point arithmetic.
