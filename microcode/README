======

This directory contains the microcode files for YASMINE. Due to its
hefty size, the microcode is currently distributed as a bz2 tarball
called `microcode.tar.bz2`. Unpack the contents of this tarball in a
directory of choice and set the environment variable `YASMV_MICROCODE`
to point to it.
