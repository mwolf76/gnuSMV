This directory contains the help files for yasmv. The help files are shown when
the corresponding help <topic> command is given in the interactive shell. These
help files can also be viewed using the standard unix man utility. Just point the
man cli to the file you want to read, like in the following example:

$ man ./check-init.nroff
