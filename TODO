BAcklog:

Added check-fsm, add-init, add-invar, add-trans

check-fsm:

-I: skip initial states checking
-T: skip trans checking

* Consistency checking of INIT (SAT?)
* Consistency checking of TRANS (SAT?)

Ok if no inconsistencies detected, false otherwise.

check-init:

kill

add-init:

Add a constraint to INIT

add-invar:

Add a constraint to INAVR

add-TRNS:

Add a constraint to TRANS




* Commands
- integration of libreadline
- autocomplete support
- help system

* CNFization algorithm
- Support for multiple CNF algorithms (no-cut, single-cut, mix-cut)

* Unified checking algorithm
- full LTL properties (not yet suported)

* SAT optimizations

* Interpolation based-algorithms
- requires interpolant-capable SAT solver

* Experiment with CEGAR, COI, Data abstraction
- functional model (i.e. introduce the := operator)

* FSM Editor + Code generator

* Emacs mode for editing [usability]
