* Refactoring

* Use BDDs instead of ADDs in the compiler

* Fixed-point types support (e.g. ufxd6.2_t, fxd10.4_t)

* CNFization algorithm
- Support for multiple CNF algorithms (no-cut, single-cut, mix-cut)

* Unified checking algorithm
- full LTL properties (not yet suported)

* SAT optimizations

* Interpolation based-algorithms
- requires interpolant-capable SAT solver

* Commands
- integration of libreadline
- autocomplete support
- help system

* Experiment with CEGAR, COI, Data abstraction
- functional model (i.e. introduce the := operator)

* FSM Editor + Code generator

* Emacs mode for editing [usability]
