TESTING
        . Arrays
        . Suite of models for integration testing

IMPLEMENTATION
        . Single-cut and Multi-cut CNF algorithms (urgent)
        . Implement and test dot-notation resolution
        . Witness mgr

REFACTORING
        . Remove support for LTL and CTL
        . Proper error management (i.e. exceptions instead of assertions)
