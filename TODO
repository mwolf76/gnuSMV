High priority tasks:
--------------------

* Unified checking algorithm (i.e.)
- propositional formulas (SAT on initial states only)
- invariant properties (G <formula>)
- full LTL properties
* Verbosity levels and Colorized output [usability]

Medium priority tasks:
----------------------

* Commands hierarchy and help system
* Efficient CNFization algorithm [core]
* Readline support
* Strip away unused parts from Cudd [maintenance]
* Consolidate Unit-testing [maintenance]

Low priority tasks:
-------------------

* Fixed-point types support (e.g. ufxd6.2_t, fxd10.4_t) [core]
* CEGAR, COI [core]
* Explore load distribution over multiple cores [experimental]
* FSM Editor + Code generator :-] [extension]
* Emacs mode for editing [usability]
