CORE
====

* Parametrized defines [X]
* Full arrays support [X]
* Enumeratives support [X]
* Check signed int support [X]
* Fancy switch-like construct
* Consolidate Unit-testing
* Fixed-point types support (e.g. ufxd6.2_t, fxd10.4)
* Casts
* Module params + cmd line support (e.g. CALL fib(10))
* FSM -> MODULE
* HALT ( __halt__ ) boolean

INIT (! HALT)

* Efficient CNFization

* COI (2h)
* BMC INVAR ALGOs (KIND + ITPs)

next (x) := fib(2) ???? mmmhhh...


EXTRA
=====

* Colorized output (2h)
* Emacs mode for editing

GUI (reachabilty)
===

* FSM Editor + Code generator (:
. States (actions)
. Transitions (guards and actions)

* FLOWCHART Editor

* TESTING
        . Arrays
        . Suite of models for integration testing

* IMPLEMENTATION
        . Single-cut and Multi-cut CNF algorithms (urgent)
        . Implement and test dot-notation resolution
        . Witness mgr

* REFACTORING
        . Remove support for LTL and CTL
        . Proper error management (i.e. exceptions instead of assertions)
