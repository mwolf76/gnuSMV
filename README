gnuSMV is a tentative and partial C++ reimplementation of the
NuSMV2 model checker. As a former member of the NuSMV2
development (in the years from 2008 to 2011) team I was never
happy with a few architectural choices that were inherited from
the long history of the NuSMV model checker and/or were due to
the amount of legacy code and tools that relied on it. Don't get
me wrong, I really think NuSMV is a great piece of software. And
I owe to the developers in FBK most - if not all - of my Software
Engineering education. Those people are really fantastic. It's
just that I've been wondering for years what that code would've
be like if one was completely free to redesign it all
from-the-scratch. This is exactly what this project is all about.
